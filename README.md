# horizon-apis

This repo contains documentation for Horizon REST APIs.

This repo is structured to feed into the developer.omnissa.com Developer Portal via the [](https://github.com/euc-dev/euc-dev.github.io) repo using MkDocs published by GitHub Pages. All documentation should be created in MarkDown format with the capabilities of MkDocs and the Material theme in mind.Only pages within the `/docs` folder should be modified within this repo.

This folder will be integrated into the [developer portal repo](https://github.com/euc-dev/euc-dev.github.io) when built using a GitHub Action.
