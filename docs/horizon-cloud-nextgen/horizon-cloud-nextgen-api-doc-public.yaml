- name: AppVersions
  description: 'AppVersion is the particular version of software installed/captured

    the 3.x terminology. This is uniquely identified by a uuid which is generated
    during the capture session. With application package merge, it is possible to
    have the same AppVersion in multiple packages and also that single Package can
    have more than one AppVersion contained in it. Eg: "Microsoft Office 2013 sp1"
    can be the application version which can be captured under a virtual application
    named "Microsoft Office", and this version can reside on a package "Microsoft_Office_2013_SP1_Clean.vhd"'

    using a marker and that can be used in an assignment. Eg: "Microsoft Office" will
    be created as an application which is the virtual application container which
    will contain "Microsoft Office 2013 sp1" as an application version under it, "Microsoft_Office_2013_SP1_Clean.vhd"

      description: 'Schema Representation for AppVersion. AppVersion is the particular
        version of software installed/captured in a given capture session. As part
        of the Cloud native capture only one AppVersion can be part of a Package.
        AppVersion was called in the past as "App Bundle" in the 3.x terminology.
        This is uniquely identified by a uuid which is generated during the capture
        session. With application package merge, it is possible to have the same AppVersion
        in multiple packages and also that single Package can have more than one AppVersion
        contained in it. Eg: "Microsoft Office 2013 sp1" can be the application version
        which can be captured under a virtual application named "Microsoft Office",
        and this version can reside on a package "Microsoft_Office_2013_SP1_Clean.vhd"
